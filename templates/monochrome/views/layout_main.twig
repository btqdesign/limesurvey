    (¯`·._.·(¯`·._.· Default Template Main Layout  ·._.·´¯)·._.·´¯)

    This is the main layout of the template.
    It is the file used to display groups and questions.

    If you're creating your own template, remember there is no obligation to respect the current file flow of this template.
    This is different from the old LimeSurvey template engine, where you had to provide every one of the pstpl files.
    Here, you must have a file called main_layout.twig (called from SurveyRuntimeHelper::run() ).
    Other than that, you're free to organize your files and inclusions as you want.



    (¯`·._.·(¯`·._.· Bootstrap ·._.·´¯)·._.·´¯)

    LimeSurvey uses Bootstrap.
    See: https://getbootstrap.com

    This template is an instance of Bootswatch Theme Flatly.
    See: https://bootswatch.com/



    (¯`·._.·(¯`·._.· Twig Engine  ·._.·´¯)·._.·´¯)

    The template engine uses Twig.
    See: http://twig.sensiolabs.org/

    The main variable is aSurveyInfo. It's an array containing the main information about the survey.
    aSurveyInfo also contains other needed arrays, such as aNavigator, or aQuestionGroups (which contain aQuestions), etc.

    If you want to see what is availabe in aSurveyInfo, turn debug mode on in application/config.php, and copy the following line to the end of the <body> element below:
    {{ dump(aSurveyInfo) }}

    To echo a variable, just insert                      : {{ variable }}
    To translate a string, just insert                   : {{ string | t }}

    NOTE: aSurveyInfo should be cleaned to remove the unnecessary data.


    (¯`·._.·(¯`·._.· Twig Engine: advanced  ·._.·´¯)·._.·´¯)

    For security reason, Twig is in a sandBox.
    About sandBox, see: http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/api.html#sandbox-extension

    Available functions/Object Methods are defined in internal.php: components => twigRenderer
    Eg:
         Functions : 'include', 'dump', 'flatEllipsizeText', 'getLanguageData', 'array_flip', 'array_intersect_key', 'registerPublicCssFile', 'getAllQuestionClasses', 'getShowqnumcode', 'intval'

         Methods   :
                    - CHtml::textfield() (and: form, link, emailField, beginForm, endForm, dropDownList,htmlButton)
                    - Survey::getAllLanguages()
                    - LSHttpRequest::getParam()

    If you need to add simple functions or static methods, just add them to internal.php.
    If you need to add complex process, use application/core/LS_Twig_Extension.php (more help/comments there)


    NOTE: Feel free to ask for functions, variables, etc, that you feel are missing - https://bugs.limesurvey.org/my_view_page.php
