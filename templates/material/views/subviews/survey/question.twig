    (¯`·._.·(¯`·._.· Question Layout  ·._.·´¯)·._.·´¯)

    This file is one of the most important of the rendering progress.
    It will render a question. It's included in the for loop in group.twig

    Here, you have access to the array aQuestion that contains the data of the current question.
    To see what's inside aQuestion, turn debug mode on, and copy the following line to the end of this file:
    {{ dump(aQuestion) }}

    All content of aQuestion itself is generated from qanda_helper.
    To modify it, you must create a question template and apply it to the question in its display settings
    (here, you're inside the survey template, applied to the survey in its settings).
